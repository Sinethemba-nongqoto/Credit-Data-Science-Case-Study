Loan Defaults

Problem Statement

Once upon a time, there was a bank offering services to private persons. The services include managing of accounts, offering loans, etc. The bank wants to improve their services by finding interesting groups of clients (e.g. to differentiate between good and bad clients). The bank managers have only vague idea, who is good client (whom to offer some additional services) and who is bad client (whom to watch carefully to minimize the bank loses).
Data overview

The bank stores data about their clients, the accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted, the credit cards issued So the bank managers hope to find some answers (and questions as well) by analyzing this data.

Class Description on Target variable

    0: Client did not default

Objective:

The objective is to build the optimal machine learning model to maximize predictive capability while decreasing the risk of future loan defaults.
